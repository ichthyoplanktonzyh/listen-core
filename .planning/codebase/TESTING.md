# Testing

## Required Local Gates

```sh
./scripts/test.sh --rust --strict
./scripts/validate-contracts.sh
cargo deny check
python3 -m unittest scripts/test_release_artifacts.py
```

## Test Layers

- crate unit tests for domain/application/provider logic;
- integration tests for SQLite, HTTP routes, lifecycle, and jobs;
- failure-injection tests for background-job writes, credential cleanup retry,
  LLTimeline resource/projection transaction rollback, migration-backup
  publication, semantic-embedding candidate download/validation/activation,
  syntax candidate activation/cleanup, and sidecar cancellation;
- semantic-embedding lifecycle tests cover restart cleanup, last-good
  retention, persisted candidate-failure provenance, final-path reload, and
  concurrent-upgrade rejection without downloading a live model;
- scripted foundation-preparation execution tests cover the exact three-resource
  plan, WordTimeline-to-Chunk dependency, independent SenseGroup execution, and
  completion without any SoundLine or phoneme-analysis job;
- preparation state tests cover cancellation CAS conflicts, input replacement,
  canonical text-snapshot invalidation after language correction/retokenization,
  restart/retry preservation, derived A/B readiness, invalid-artifact rebuild,
  and stable plan identity after artifacts appear;
- content-preparation tests cover content-level single-flight, exact existing
  subtitle reuse, typed subtitle/audio ambiguity, deterministic ASR child
  recovery, automatic compatible-model selection, retry lineage, cancellation,
  and handoff to the foundation child without SoundLine or phoneme analysis;
- timeline persistence tests cover atomic activate-if-absent for WordTimeline,
  ChunkTimeline, and SenseGroup, including preservation of an existing active
  user selection and the WordTimeline legacy-timing invariant;
- local realtime contract fixtures for snapshot transcripts, chunk merging,
  loopback/keyless policy, plus sidecar pool-readiness and process reaping;
- OpenAPI method+path parity and structural validation;
- committed schema/example/fixture validation;
- deterministic Python unit/contract tests;
- architecture debt regression tests and dependency policy checks;
- release archive safety, reproducibility, manifest, and SHA checks;
- runtime smoke outside the source tree.

## Rules

- Run focused tests while iterating, then boundary-appropriate gates.
- Normal tests never require real credentials or paid model calls.
- Contract changes always run contract validation.
- Persistence changes include migration and repository integration tests.
- Runtime/release changes include package, verify, and smoke.
- Report exact commands and failures. Zero-step GitHub Actions failure caused by
  billing is infrastructure, not a passing or failing code test.
