# Changelog

## 0.7.0 - 2026-06-13

- Integrated the modular Flutter controller/widget architecture while
  preserving Milestone 1.9 pronunciation and word-sync behavior.
- Fixed nullable controller state so media, subtitle, selection, diagnosis,
  and loop state can be cleared without retaining stale values.
- Provider-neutral pronunciation, phoneme, speech-rule, and word-timing
  contracts with schema v8.
- Pinned CMUdict canonical en-US pronunciation with deterministic fallback,
  lexical stress, ARPAbet, IPA display, variants, and token mapping.
- Deterministic bounded word timings for ordinary subtitles and local
  current-word highlighting that remains correct after seek, loop, and rate
  changes.
- Rule-based weak form, contraction, linking, flapping, deletion, and
  assimilation hints from a fixed 18-rule catalog that explicitly does not
  claim real-audio detection.
- Provider/version-isolated canonical pronunciation caching, explicit cache
  invalidation events, and non-blocking track jobs with cancellation and retry.
- Desktop settings v7, pronunciation diagnostics, API/event contracts, and
  Milestone 1.9 automated verification.
- Fixed current-word timing loading by reading the API contract fields
  `timing_source` and `provider_id`.
- Added background, scale-bounce, and glow current-word styles while keeping
  word-timing provenance in diagnostics instead of the playback overlay.
- Confirmed AV1 playback during collaborative functional acceptance.
- Removed the startup stall caused by re-hashing installed learning resources,
  added an explicit core-starting/error/retry screen, and fixed short-sentence
  ECDICT phrase scanning.
- Completed collaborative functional acceptance. Independent Developer ID
  distribution signing and notarization remain deferred release work.

## 0.6.0 - acceptance candidate

- Unified word and user-confirmed phrase learning assets with schema v7 and
  vocabulary asset bundle v3.
- Versioned lemma normalization, persistent corrections, and phrase candidates.
- Clickable phrase underlines in learning subtitles; confirmed phrases remain
  independent assets with their own status and source ranges.
- Explicit checksum-verified ECDICT and CMUdict resource manager.
- Provider-neutral OpenSubtitles title, filename, and media-hash workflows.
- Provider-supplied pronunciation audio in the unified word learning panel.
- Vocabulary asset v3 import preserves newer local state and independently
  merges learning content, history, and durable source encounters.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-06-10

Milestone 1.7 local ASR learning subtitle release.

- Provider-, runtime-, model-, and profile-neutral transcription contracts.
- Durable single-concurrency whole-media jobs with progress, cancellation,
  retry, restart interruption handling, provenance, and idempotent completion.
- whisper.cpp model catalog, explicit verified downloads, custom model
  registration, model management, and persistent job center.
- Generated subtitles become ordinary interactive learning tracks and support
  SRT export.
- Reproducible macOS arm64 whisper.cpp and LGPL-only FFmpeg runtime build,
  license validation, application bundling, and deterministic fake-runtime
  acceptance test.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-06-10

- Draggable viewport-relative subtitle placement, independent primary/secondary
  font controls, and a stable video viewport when subtitle visibility changes.
- Restored the media-kit video texture layout after the subtitle overlay
  refactor, fixing the black video screen regression.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-06-10

Milestone 1.6 desktop learning experience release.

- Responsive subtitle presets and automatic native-subtitle suppression.
- Simplified Chinese and English desktop localization.
- TXT/CSV existing vocabulary import with conflict-safe status initialization.
- Unified word learning panel with durable user definitions and notes.
- Provider-agnostic aggregated dictionary API and multi-source UI.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-10

Milestone 1.5 vocabulary learning asset release.

- Status-driven vocabulary books with user-selected status as the authority.
- Durable status history and source sentence snapshots.
- Missing-media recovery and independent vocabulary asset backup/restore.
- Latest-effective context observations with clear support.
- Schema v4 migration with legacy history and source backfill.
